# Nonrepeating Character

Have the function NonrepeatingCharacter(str) take the str parameter being passed,
which will contain only alphabetic characters and spaces, and
return the first non-repeating character.

For example: if str is **agettkgaeee** then your program should return **k**. The string will always contain at least one character and there will always be at least one non-repeating character.

## Examples

```
Input: "abcdef"
Output: a
```

```
Input: "hello world hi hey"
Output: w
```

## Automatic tests

Run the `rake` command from the terminal to run the automated tests.
